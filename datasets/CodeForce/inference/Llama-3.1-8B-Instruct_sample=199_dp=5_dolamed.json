Channel\nPetya is an administrator of a channel in one of the messengers. A total of $$$n$$$ people are subscribed to his channel, and Petya is not considered a subscriber.\nPetya has published a new post on the channel. At the moment of the publication, there were $$$a$$$ subscribers online. We assume that every subscriber always reads all posts in the channel if they are online.\nAfter this, Petya starts monitoring the number of subscribers online. He consecutively receives $$$q$$$ notifications of the form \"a subscriber went offline\" or \"a subscriber went online\". Petya does not know which exact subscriber goes online or offline. It is guaranteed that such a sequence of notifications could have indeed been received.\nPetya wonders if all of his subscribers have read the new post. Help him by determining one of the following:\nit is impossible that all $$$n$$$ subscribers have read the post;\nit is possible that all $$$n$$$ subscribers have read the post;\nit is guaranteed that all $$$n$$$ subscribers have read the post.\nInput\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$, $$$0 \\le a \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le q \\le 100$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of subscribers of the channel, the initial number of subscribers online, and the number of notifications.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string of length $$$q$$$, consisting of characters '\n+\n' and '\n-\n'. The $$$i$$$-th of these characters is '\n+\n', if the $$$i$$$-th notification tells that a subscriber goes online, and it is '\n-\n' otherwise.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line: \"\nYES\n\" if all $$$n$$$ subscribers are guaranteed to have read the post, \"\nNO\n\" if it is impossible for all $$$n$$$ subscribers to have read the post, and \"\nMAYBE\n\" otherwise.\nExample\nInput\n4\n5 5 3\n--+\n5 2 3\n++-\n5 4 2\n-+\n5 0 7\n++++-++\nOutput\nYES\nNO\nMAYBE\nYES\nNote\nIn the first test case, there are $$$5$$$ out of $$$5$$$ subscribers online in the very beginning, so they will all read the post no matter what. The answer is \"\nYES\n\".\nIn the second test case, the number of subscribers online becomes $$$4$$$ after the first two notifications, next someone goes offline, and thus the fifth subscriber has no chance of reading the post. It is impossible for all the subscribers to read the post, so the answer is \"\nNO\n\".\nIn the third test case, on the one hand, the same person may have gone offline and online (in this case only $$$4$$$ out of $$$5$$$ subscribers have read the post), on the other hand, the last notification may have told that the fifth subscriber has gone online (in this case all subscribers have read the post). We cannot deduce which of the two holds, so the answer is \"\nMAYBE\n\".\nIn the fourth test case, there have to be five subscribers online after all the notifications. All of them will read the post, so the answer is \"\nYES\n\".",

You can use any library you want. The test cases are provided in the code. Do not call the solve() function in your code. \nProgramming Problem: B. Sequence Game\nTema and Vika are playing the following game.\nFirst, Vika comes up with a sequence of positive integers $$$a$$$ of length $$$m$$$ and writes it down on a piece of paper. Then she takes a new piece of paper and writes down the sequence $$$b$$$ according to the following rule:\nFirst, she writes down $$$a_1$$$.\nThen, she writes down only those $$$a_i$$$ ($$$2 \\le i \\le m$$$) such that $$$a_{i - 1} \\le a_i$$$. Let the length of this sequence be denoted as $$$n$$$.\nFor example, from the sequence $$$a=[4, 3, 2, 6, 3, 3]$$$, Vika will obtain the sequence $$$b=[4, 6, 3]$$$.\nShe then gives the piece of paper with the sequence $$$b$$$ to Tema. He, in turn, tries to guess the sequence $$$a$$$.\nTema considers winning in such a game highly unlikely, but still wants to find at least one sequence $$$a$$$ that could have been originally chosen by Vika. Help him and output any such sequence.\nNote that the length of the sequence you output should not exceed the input sequence length by more than two times.\nInput\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line of input data contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.

The `solve` function reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid and the grid itself, and then checks if Vika's name can be found in the grid. If it can, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.",

The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 50$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the array $$$a$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10 ^ 9$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the elements of the array $$$a$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of operations that Alphen will perform.\nExample\nInput\n7\n3\n1 2 3\n5\n2 1 2 1 2\n4\n3 1 5 4\n2\n7 7\n5\n4 1 3 2 5\n5\n2 3 1 4 5\n3\n1000000000 1 2\nOutput\n0\n2\n5\n0\n4\n3\n1000000000\nNote\nIn the first test case, we have $$$a=[1,2,3]$$$. Since $$$a$$$ is already sorted, Alphen will not need to perform any operations. So, the answer is $$$0$$$.\nIn the second test case, we have $$$a=[2,1,2,1,2]$$$. Since $$$a$$$ is not initially sorted, Alphen will perform one operation to make $$$a=[1,0,1,0,1]$$$. After performing one operation, $$$a$$$ is still not sorted, so Alphen will perform another operation to make $$$a=[0,0,0,0,0]$$$. Since $$$a$$$ is sorted, Alphen will not perform any other operations. Since Alphen has performed two operations in total, the answer is $$$2$$$."

Morning Sandwich\nProgramming constraints: DO NOT use the following techniques\n- \n- for loop\n- two pointers\n- tuple\n- if statement\nMonocarp always starts his morning with a good ol' sandwich. Sandwiches Monocarp makes always consist of bread, cheese and/or ham.\nA sandwich always follows the formula:\na piece of bread\na slice of cheese or ham\na piece of bread\n$$$\\dots$$$\na slice of cheese or ham\na piece of bread\nSo it always has bread on top and at the bottom, and it alternates between bread and filling, where filling is a slice of either cheese or ham. Each piece of bread and each slice of cheese or ham is called a layer.\nToday Monocarp woke up and discovered that he has $$$b$$$ pieces of bread, $$$c$$$ slices of cheese and $$$h$$$ slices of ham. What is the maximum number of layers his morning sandwich can have?\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of testcases.\nEach testcase consists of three integers $$$b, c$$$ and $$$h$$$ ($$$2 \\le b \\le 100$$$; $$$1 \\le c, h \\le 100$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of pieces of bread, slices of cheese and slices of ham, respectively.\nOutput\nFor each testcase, print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum number of layers Monocarp's morning sandwich can have.\nExample\nInput\n3\n2 1 1\n10 1 2\n3 7 8\nOutput\n3\n7\n5\nNote\nIn the first testcase, Monocarp can arrange a sandwich with three layers: either a piece of bread, a slice of cheese and another piece of bread, or a piece of bread, a slice of ham and another piece of bread.\nIn the second testcase, Monocarp has a lot of bread, but not too much filling. He can arrange a sandwich with four pieces of bread, one slice of cheese and two slices of ham.\nIn the third testcase, it's the opposite\u00a0\u2014 Monocarp has a lot of filling, but not too much bread. He can arrange a sandwich with three pieces of bread and two slices of cheese, for example."

A group with only one villager has a power of $$$0$$$.\nKars\nwants to break the villagers into exactly $$$k$$$ contiguous subgroups so that the sum of their power is minimized. Formally, he must find $$$k - 1$$$ positive integers $$$1 \\le r_1 < r_2 < \\ldots < r_{k - 1} < n$$$ such that $$$f(1, r_1) + f(r_1 + 1, r_2) + \\ldots + f(r_{k-1} + 1, n)$$$ is minimised. Help\nKars\nin finding the minimum value of $$$f(1, r_1) + f(r_1 + 1, r_2) + \\ldots + f(r_{k-1} + 1, n)$$$.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\leq t \\leq 100)$$$\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n,k$$$ $$$(1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 100)$$$\u00a0\u2014 the number of villagers and the number of groups they must be split into.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\leq a_i \\leq 500)$$$\u00a0\u2014 the suspicion of each of the villagers.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible value of sum of power of all the groups i.\u00a0e. the minimum possible value of $$$f(1,r_1) + f(r_1 + 1, r_2) + \\ldots + f(r_{k-1} + 1, n)$$$.\nExample\nInput\n3\n4 2\n1 3 5 2\n6 3\n1 9 12 4 7 2\n12 8\n1 9 8 2 3 3 1 8 7 7 9 2\nOutput\n4\n11\n2\nNote\nIn the first test case, we will group the villagers with suspicion $$$(1,3,5,2)$$$ into $$$(1,3,5)$$$ and $$$(2)$$$. So, $$$f(1,3) + f(4,4) = (|1 - 3| + |3 - 5|) + 0 = 4 + 0 = 4$$$.\nIn the second test case, we will group the villagers with suspicion $$$(1,9,12,4,7,2)$$$ into $$$(1),(9,12),(4,7,2)$$$. So, $$$f(1,1) + f(2,3) + f(4,6) = 0 + 3 + 8 = 11$$$."

The player who is unable to make a move loses.\nFind a positive integer $$$n$$$ such that the second player to move in this game has a winning strategy. This means that no matter what moves the first player makes, the second player can carefully choose their moves (possibly depending on the first player's moves) to ensure they win.\nInput\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a < b \\le 100$$$).\nOutput\nFor each test case, output any positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$) such that the second player to move wins.\nIt can be proven that such an $$$n$$$ always exists under the constraints of the problem.\nExample\nInput\n3\n1 4\n1 5\n9 26\nOutput\n2\n6\n3\nNote\nIn the first test case, when $$$n = 2$$$, the first player must remove $$$a = 1$$$ stone. Then, the second player can respond by removing $$$a = 1$$$ stone. The first player can no longer make a move, so the second player wins.\nIn the second test case, when $$$n = 6$$$, the first player has two options:\nIf they remove $$$b = 5$$$ stones, then the second player can respond by removing $$$a = 1$$$ stone. The first player can no longer make a move, so the second player wins.\nIf they remove $$$a = 1$$$ stone, then the second player can respond by removing $$$a = 1$$$ stone. Afterwards, the players can only alternate removing exactly $$$a = 1$$$ stone. The second player will take the last stone and win.\nSince the second player has a winning strategy no matter what the first player does, this is an acceptable output.\nIn the third test case, the first player cannot make any moves when $$$n = 3$$$, so the second player immediately wins."

They have a blackboard; initially, there are $$$n$$$ integers written on it, and each integer is equal to $$$1$$$.\nAlice and Bob take turns; Alice goes first. On their turn, the player has to choose several (\nat least two\n)\nequal\nintegers on the board, wipe them and write a new integer which is equal to their sum.\nFor example, if the board currently contains integers $$$\\{1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3\\}$$$, then the following moves are possible:\nchoose two integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipe them and write an integer $$$2$$$, then the board becomes $$$\\{2, 2, 2, 2, 3\\}$$$;\nchoose two integers equal to $$$2$$$, wipe them and write an integer $$$4$$$, then the board becomes $$$\\{1, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$$$;\nchoose three integers equal to $$$2$$$, wipe them and write an integer $$$6$$$, then the board becomes $$$\\{1, 1, 3, 6\\}$$$.\nIf a player cannot make a move (all integers on the board are different), that player\nwins the game\n.\nDetermine who wins if both players play optimally.\nInput\nThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 99$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of one line containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) \u2014 the number of integers equal to $$$1$$$ on the board.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print\nAlice\nif Alice wins when both players play optimally. Otherwise, print\nBob\n.\nExample\nInput\n2\n3\n6\nOutput\nBob\nAlice\nNote\nIn the first test case, $$$n = 3$$$, so the board initially contains integers $$$\\{1, 1, 1\\}$$$. We can show that Bob can always win as follows: there are two possible first moves for Alice.\nif Alice chooses two integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$2$$$, the board becomes $$$\\{1, 2\\}$$$. Bob cannot make a move, so he wins;\nif Alice chooses three integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$3$$$, the board becomes $$$\\{3\\}$$$. Bob cannot make a move, so he wins.\nIn the second test case, $$$n = 6$$$, so the board initially contains integers $$$\\{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\\}$$$. Alice can win by, for example, choosing two integers equal to $$$1$$$, wiping them and writing $$$2$$$ on the first turn. Then the board becomes $$$\\{1, 1, 1, 1, 2\\}$$$, and there are three possible responses for Bob:\nif Bob chooses four integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$4$$$, the board becomes $$$\\{2,4\\}$$$. Alice cannot make a move, so she wins;\nif Bob chooses three integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$3$$$, the board becomes $$$\\{1,2,3\\}$$$. Alice cannot make a move, so she wins;\nif Bob chooses two integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$2$$$, the board becomes $$$\\{1, 1, 2, 2\\}$$$. Alice can continue by, for example, choosing two integers equal to $$$2$$$, wiping them and writing $$$4$$$. Then the board becomes $$$\\{1,1,4\\}$$$. The only possible response for Bob is to choose two integers equal to $$$1$$$ and write $$$2$$$ instead of them; then the board becomes $$$\\{2,4\\}$$$, Alice cannot make a move, so she wins."

You can use any library you want. The test cases are provided in the code. Do not call the solve() function in your code. \nProgramming Problem: A. Yura's New Name\nAfter holding one team contest, boy Yura got very tired and wanted to change his life and move to Japan. In honor of such a change, Yura changed his name to something nice.\nFascinated by this idea he already thought up a name $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters \"\n_\n\" and \"\n^\n\". But there's a problem \u2014 Yura likes smiley faces \"\n^_^\n\" and \"\n^^\n\". Therefore any character of the name must be a part of at least one such smiley. Note that only the\nconsecutive\ncharacters of the name can be a smiley face.\nMore formally, consider all occurrences of the strings \"\n^_^\n\" and \"\n^^\n\" in the string $$$s$$$. Then all such occurrences must cover the whole string $$$s$$$, possibly with intersections. For example, in the string \"\n^^__^_^^__^\n\" the characters at positions $$$3,4,9,10$$$ and $$$11$$$ are not contained inside any smileys, and the other characters at positions $$$1,2,5,6,7$$$ and $$$8$$$ are contained inside smileys.\nIn one operation Jura can insert one of the characters \"\n_\n\" and \"\n^\n\" into his name $$$s$$$ (you can insert it at any position in the string). He asks you to tell him the minimum number of operations you need to do to make the name fit Yura's criteria.\nInput\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$)\u00a0\u2014the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\leq |s| \\leq 100$$$), consisting of characters \"\n_\n\" and \"\n^\n\", \u00a0\u2014 the name to change.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of characters you need to add to the name to make it fit for Yura.

In this case, they all agree during the first two discussions, after which the third member is in the minority during the third discussion. Then, the first and fifth members agree in the last discussion, and those two members stay till the end of the meeting.\nExample 5:\nThe club has $$$4$$$ members and $$$2$$$ opinions will be discussed.\nIf the first three members attend the meeting, the first member will be in the minority during the first discussion and will leave the club. After that, the second and third members will both disagree with the second opinion, and they both will stay till the end of the meeting. In this way, there will be 2 members left after the meeting, but it is an invalid outcome, as it forces the first member to leave. Therefore, the maximum number of 1 member is achieved if only the first member attends the meeting.",

For example, $$$[3,2,3]$$$ is a good sequence, since $$$a_{2} = 2$$$, $$$a_{3} = 3$$$, while $$$[3,1,1]$$$ is not a good sequence, since there is no $$$i$$$ such that $$$a_{i} = i$$$.\nA sequence $$$a$$$ is\nbeautiful\n, if and only if there exists at least one subsequence of $$$a$$$ satisfying that this subsequence is good. For example, $$$[4,3,2]$$$ is a beautiful sequence, since its subsequence $$$[4,2]$$$ is good, while $$$[5,3,4]$$$ is not a beautiful sequence.\nA sequence $$$b$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.\nNow you are given a sequence, check whether it is beautiful or not.\nInput\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Their description follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) \u2014 the length of the given sequence.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_{i} \\le 10^9$$$), representing the sequence.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output \"\nYES\n\" or \"\nNO\n\"(without quotes) in one line, representing whether the given sequence is beautiful.\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"\nyEs\n\", \"\nyes\n\", \"\nYes\n\", and \"\nYES\n\" will be recognized as positive responses.\nExample\nInput\n7\n3\n3 2 1\n4\n2 4 3 5\n5\n2 3 5 5 6\n2\n3 1\n5\n2 4 5 2 3\n4\n5 6 7 8\n6\n6 5 4 3 2 1\nOutput\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNote\nIn the first test case, the good subsequence is $$$b=[3,2]$$$, where $$$b_{2} = 2$$$.\nIn the second test case, the good subsequence is $$$b=[2,4,3]$$$, where $$$b_{3} = 3$$$.\nIn the fourth test case, the good subsequence is $$$b=[1]$$$, where $$$b_{1} = 1$$$.\nIn the fifth test case, the good subsequence is $$$b=[2,2]$$$, where $$$b_{2} = 2$$$."

Also:\nstring must start with non-empty sequence consisting only of characters '\nm\n' or '\nM\n'\nit must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters '\ne\n' or '\nE\n'\nit must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters '\no\n' or '\nO\n'\nit must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters '\nw\n' or '\nW\n', this sequence ends the string, after it immediately comes the string end\nFor example, strings \"\nmeow\n\", \"\nmmmEeOWww\n\", \"\nMeOooOw\n\" describe a meowing, but strings \"\nMweo\n\", \"\nMeO\n\", \"\nmoew\n\", \"\nMmEW\n\", \"\nmeowmeow\n\" do not.\nDetermine whether the sound you heard was a cat meowing or something else.\nInput\nThe first line of input data contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\nThe description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 50$$$) \u2014 the length of the string describing the sound.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ characters. The string describes the sound you heard and consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output on a separate line:\nYES\nif the sound was a cat meowing;\nNO\notherwise.\nYou can output\nYES\nand\nNO\nin any case (for example, strings\nyEs\n,\nyes\n,\nYes\nand\nYES\nwill be recognized as positive response).\nExample\nInput\n7\n4\nmeOw\n14\nmMmeoOoWWWwwwW\n3\nmew\n7\nMmeEeUw\n4\nMEOW\n6\nMmyaVW\n5\nmeowA\nOutput\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNote\nIn the first test case, the string consists of a sequence of characters '\nm\n', '\ne\n', '\nO\n', '\nw\n', which satisfies the definition of meowing.\nIn the second test case, the string consists of a sequence of $$$3$$$ characters '\nm\n' and '\nM\n', one '\ne\n', a sequence of $$$3$$$ characters '\no\n' and '\nO\n' and a sequence of $$$7$$$ characters '\nw\n' and '\nW\n', which satisfies the definition of meowing.\nIn the third test case, the string does not describe a meowing because it lacks a sequence of '\no\n' or '\nO\n' characters between '\ne\n' and '\nw\n'.\nIn the fourth test case, the string contains the character '\nU\n', so it does not describe a meowing.",

Also there are infinitely many posts not in the field, numbered with integers $$$n + 1, n + 2, \\ldots$$$.\nWhen recent action happens in the post $$$p$$$:\nIf it is in the \"Recent Actions\" field, it moves from its position to the top position.\nOtherwise, it is added to the top position, and the post on the down position is removed from the \"Recent Actions\" field.\nYou know, that the next $$$m$$$ recent actions will happen in the posts $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_m$$$ ($$$n + 1 \\leq p_i \\leq n + m$$$) in the moments of time $$$1, 2, \\ldots, m$$$.\nNote\n, that recent actions only happen with posts with numbers $$$\\geq n + 1$$$.\nFor each post $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$), find the first time it will be removed from the \"Recent Actions\" field or say, that it won't be removed.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Descriptions of test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^4$$$) \u2014 the size of the \"Recent Actions\" field and the number of actions.\nThe next line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_m$$$ ($$$n + 1 \\leq p_i \\leq n + m$$$).\nIt is guaranteed, that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^4$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case print $$$n$$$ integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_n$$$, where $$$t_i=-1$$$ if the post $$$i$$$ won't be removed or $$$t_i$$$ equals to the first moment of time the post $$$i$$$ will be removed ($$$1 \\leq t_i \\leq m$$$).\nExample\nInput\n10\n1 1\n2\n3 2\n5 4\n4 5\n5 9 9 5 7\n5 5\n6 7 8 9 10\n3 4\n4 4 4 4\n4 4\n5 5 6 6\n3 5\n4 5 5 5 4\n4 20\n5 5 24 24 24 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n5 7\n7 8 7 11 7 12 10\n6 7\n8 11 7 8 8 8 12\nOutput\n1 \n-1 2 1 \n-1 5 2 1 \n5 4 3 2 1 \n-1 -1 1 \n-1 -1 3 1 \n-1 2 1 \n8 7 3 1 \n7 6 4 2 1 \n-1 -1 7 3 2 1\nNote\nIn the first test case, the only post $$$1$$$ will be removed at the moment $$$1$$$ and replaced by the post $$$2$$$.\nIn the second test case the \"Recent Actions\" field will be (given an order from top to down):\nBefore moment $$$1$$$: $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$, after moment $$$1$$$: $$$[5, 1, 2]$$$. Post number $$$3$$$ was removed.\nBefore moment $$$2$$$: $$$[5, 1, 2]$$$, after moment $$$2$$$: $$$[4, 5, 1]$$$.

However, since you specifically mentioned not to use while or for loops, I used recursion instead.

If 'c' is in the character, it prints \"YES\", otherwise it prints \"NO\". \n\nHowever, if you want to avoid recursion, you can use the following code which uses the built-in any() function and a generator expression to check if 'c' is in the character:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        c = input()\n        print(\"YES\" if any('c' in x for x in c) else \"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```\n\nThis code does the same thing as the previous one, but it uses a generator expression to check if 'c' is in the character. The any() function returns True if at least one element of the iterable is true, and False otherwise.",

It iterates over the array, incrementing the corresponding counter for each number, and increments `ans` whenever it encounters a pair of adjacent numbers with the same parity. The function returns the total number of operations required."

The judge could have walked Boy, for instance, during the time intervals $$$[440, 560]$$$ and $$$[980, 1100]$$$. The situation is illustrated in the picture below, where the walks are represented by green intervals.\n$$$$$$$$$$$$\nIn the\nthird test case\n, the times are the same as in the first test case, but $$$1000$$$ is missing. The judge could have walked Boy at most once.\nIn the\nfourth test case\n, Boy could have been walked during the time intervals $$$[739, 859]$$$ and $$$[859, 979]$$$."

Block Towers\nProgramming constraints: DO NOT use the following techniques\n- \n- hashmap\n- if statement\n- recursion\n- for loop\nThere are $$$n$$$ block towers, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th tower consists of $$$a_i$$$ blocks.\nIn one move, you can move one block from tower $$$i$$$ to tower $$$j$$$, but only if $$$a_i > a_j$$$. That move increases $$$a_j$$$ by $$$1$$$ and decreases $$$a_i$$$ by $$$1$$$. You can perform as many moves as you would like (possibly, zero).\nWhat's the largest amount of blocks you can have on the tower $$$1$$$ after the moves?\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of testcases.\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of towers.\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of blocks on each tower.\nThe sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\nOutput\nFor each testcase, print the largest amount of blocks you can have on the tower $$$1$$$ after you make any number of moves (possibly, zero).\nExample\nInput\n4\n3\n1 2 3\n3\n1 2 2\n2\n1 1000000000\n10\n3 8 6 7 4 1 2 4 10 1\nOutput\n3\n2\n500000001\n9\nNote\nIn the first testcase, you can move a block from tower $$$2$$$ to tower $$$1$$$, making the block counts $$$[2, 1, 3]$$$. Then move a block from tower $$$3$$$ to tower $$$1$$$, making the block counts $$$[3, 1, 2]$$$. Tower $$$1$$$ has $$$3$$$ blocks in it, and you can't obtain a larger amount.\nIn the second testcase, you can move a block from any of towers $$$2$$$ or $$$3$$$ to tower $$$1$$$, so that it has $$$2$$$ blocks in it.\nIn the third testcase, you can $$$500000000$$$ times move a block from tower $$$2$$$ to tower $$$1$$$.

Broken Keyboard\nRecently, Mishka started noticing that his keyboard malfunctions \u2014 maybe it's because he was playing rhythm games too much. Empirically, Mishka has found out that every other time he presses a key, it is registered as if the key was pressed twice. For example, if Mishka types text, the first time he presses a key, exactly one letter is printed; the second time he presses a key, two same letters are printed; the third time he presses a key, one letter is printed; the fourth time he presses a key, two same letters are printed, and so on. Note that the number of times a key was pressed is counted for the whole keyboard, not for each key separately.

Two 0-1 Sequences\nAquaMoon has two binary sequences $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, which contain only $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$.
