It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the minimum number of seconds required to enter the pin code. The BFS is implemented using a queue, where each element in the queue is a tuple containing the current position `(x, y)`, the step number, and the current count of seconds. The function uses a 2D boolean array `vis` to keep track of visited positions. The function iterates over the pin code, and for each position, it checks all adjacent digits and adds them to the queue if they have not been visited before. The function returns the minimum count of seconds when it reaches the last position of the pin code.",

Note that the mass of water poured in one move\ndoes not have to be an integer\n.\nWhat is the minimum number of moves required to make the masses of water in the vessels equal? Note that you cannot perform any actions other than the described moves.\nInput\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nEach test case consists of a single line containing three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b, c \\le 100$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the mass of water in the vessels and the capacity of the cup, respectively.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single number\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of moves required to make the masses of water in the vessels equal. It can be shown, that it is always possible.\nExample\nInput\n6\n3 7 2\n17 4 3\n17 17 1\n17 21 100\n1 100 1\n97 4 3\nOutput\n1\n3\n0\n1\n50\n16\nNote\nIn the first test case, only one move is enough: if we pour $$$2$$$ grams of water from the second vessel into the first one, both vessels will contain $$$5$$$ grams of water.\nIn the second example test case, three moves are enough:\nPour $$$3$$$ grams of water from the first vessel into the second one. After this move, the first vessel will contain $$$17 - 3 = 14$$$ grams of water, and the second vessel will contain $$$4 + 3 = 7$$$ grams.\nPour $$$2$$$ grams of water from the first vessel into the second one. After this move, the first vessel will contain $$$14 - 2 = 12$$$ grams of water, and the second vessel will contain $$$7 + 2 = 9$$$ grams.\nFinally, pour $$$1.5$$$ grams of water from the first vessel into the second one. After this move, the first vessel will contain $$$12 - 1.5 = 10.5$$$ grams of water, and the second vessel will contain $$$9 + 1.5 = 10.5$$$ grams.\nNote that this is not the only way to equalize the vessels in $$$3$$$ moves, but there is no way to do it in $$$2$$$ moves.\nIn the third example test case, the vessels initially contain the same amount of water, so no moves are needed.

Chaneka can do that operation multiple times, even for different elements.\nWhat is the minimum number of operations that must be done to make it such that $$$A_1 \\times A_2 \\times A_3 \\times \\ldots \\times A_N = 0$$$?\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$N$$$ ($$$1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$$$).\nThe second line contains $$$N$$$ integers $$$A_1, A_2, A_3, \\ldots, A_N$$$ ($$$-10^5 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^5$$$).\nOutput\nAn integer representing the minimum number of operations that must be done to make it such that $$$A_1 \\times A_2 \\times A_3 \\times \\ldots \\times A_N = 0$$$.\nExamples\nInput\n3\n2 -6 5\nOutput\n2\nInput\n1\n-3\nOutput\n3\nInput\n5\n0 -1 0 1 0\nOutput\n0\nNote\nIn the first example, initially, $$$A_1\\times A_2\\times A_3=2\\times(-6)\\times5=-60$$$. Chaneka can do the following sequence of operations:\nDecrease the value of $$$A_1$$$ by $$$1$$$. Then, $$$A_1\\times A_2\\times A_3=1\\times(-6)\\times5=-30$$$\nDecrease the value of $$$A_1$$$ by $$$1$$$. Then, $$$A_1\\times A_2\\times A_3=0\\times(-6)\\times5=0$$$\nIn the third example, Chaneka does not have to do any operations, because from the start, it already holds that $$$A_1\\times A_2\\times A_3\\times A_4\\times A_5=0\\times(-1)\\times0\\times1\\times0=0$$$"

There are a total of $$$n$$$ passengers. The escalator has a total of $$$m$$$ steps, all steps indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ and $$$i$$$-th step has height $$$i \\cdot k$$$.\nVlad's height is $$$H$$$ centimeters. Two people with heights $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ can have a conversation on the escalator if they are standing on\ndifferent\nsteps and the height difference between them is equal to the height difference between the steps.\nFor example, if two people have heights $$$170$$$ and $$$180$$$ centimeters, and $$$m = 10, k = 5$$$, then they can stand on steps numbered $$$7$$$ and $$$5$$$, where the height difference between the steps is equal to the height difference between the two people: $$$k \\cdot 2 = 5 \\cdot 2 = 10 = 180 - 170$$$. There are other possible ways.\nGiven an array $$$h$$$ of size $$$n$$$, where $$$h_i$$$ represents the height of the $$$i$$$-th person. Vlad is interested in how many people he can have a conversation with on the escalator\nindividually\n.\nFor example, if $$$n = 5, m = 3, k = 3, H = 11$$$, and $$$h = [5, 4, 14, 18, 2]$$$, Vlad can have a conversation with the person with height $$$5$$$ (Vlad will stand on step $$$1$$$, and the other person will stand on step $$$3$$$) and with the person with height $$$14$$$ (for example, Vlad can stand on step $$$3$$$, and the other person will stand on step $$$2$$$). Vlad cannot have a conversation with the person with height $$$2$$$ because even if they stand on the extreme steps of the escalator, the height difference between them will be $$$6$$$, while their height difference is $$$9$$$.

Ten Words of Wisdom\nProgramming constraints: DO NOT use the following techniques\n- recursion\n- while loop\n- for loop\n- tuple\n- if statement\nIn the game show \"Ten Words of Wisdom\", there are $$$n$$$ participants numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, each of whom submits one response. The $$$i$$$-th response is $$$a_i$$$ words long and has quality $$$b_i$$$. No two responses have the same quality, and at least one response has length at most $$$10$$$.\nThe winner of the show is the response which has the highest quality out of all responses that are not longer than $$$10$$$ words. Which response is the winner?\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 50$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of responses.\nThen $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of which contains two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i, b_i \\leq 50$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of words and the quality of the $$$i$$$-th response, respectively.\nAdditional constraints on the input:\nin each test case, at least one value of $$$i$$$ satisfies $$$a_i \\leq 10$$$, and all values of $$$b_i$$$ are distinct.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing one integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x \\leq n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the winner of the show, according to the rules given in the statement.\nIt can be shown that, according to the constraints in the statement, exactly one winner exists for each test case.\nExample\nInput\n3\n5\n7 2\n12 5\n9 3\n9 4\n10 1\n3\n1 2\n3 4\n5 6\n1\n1 43\nOutput\n4\n3\n1\nNote\nIn the first test case, the responses provided are as follows:\nResponse 1: $$$7$$$ words, quality $$$2$$$\nResponse 2: $$$12$$$ words, quality $$$5$$$\nResponse 3: $$$9$$$ words, quality $$$3$$$\nResponse 4: $$$9$$$ words, quality $$$4$$$\nResponse 5: $$$10$$$ words, quality $$$1$$$\nWe can see that the responses with indices $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, and $$$5$$$ have lengths not exceeding $$$10$$$ words.

The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of array and parameter $$$k$$$ from the statement.\nOutput\nFor each test case output one integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible number of ones in a good array.\nIt can be shown that under the given constraints at least one good array always exists.\nExample\nInput\n7\n3 2\n5 2\n9 3\n7 1\n10 4\n9 5\n8 8\nOutput\n2\n3\n4\n7\n4\n3\n2\nNote\nIn the first test case, $$$n = 3$$$ and $$$k = 2$$$:\nArray $$$[ \\, 1, 0, 1 \\, ]$$$ is good and the number of ones in it is $$$2$$$.\nArrays $$$[ \\, 0, 0, 0 \\, ]$$$, $$$[ \\, 0, 1, 0 \\, ]$$$ and $$$[ \\, 0, 0, 1 \\, ]$$$ are not good since for $$$i=1$$$ the first condition from the statement is not satisfied.\nArray $$$[ \\, 1, 0, 0 \\, ]$$$ is not good since for $$$i=1$$$ the second condition from the statement is not satisfied.\nAll other arrays of length $$$3$$$ contain at least $$$2$$$ ones.\nThus, the answer is $$$2$$$.\nIn the second test case, $$$n = 5$$$ and $$$k = 2$$$:\nArray $$$[ \\, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1 \\, ]$$$ is not good since for $$$i=3$$$ the second condition is not satisfied.\nArray $$$[ \\, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1 \\, ]$$$ is good and the number of ones in it is $$$3$$$.\nIt can be shown that there is no good array with less than $$$3$$$ ones, so the answer is $$$3$$$.\nIn the third test case, $$$n = 9$$$ and $$$k = 3$$$:\nArray $$$[ \\, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1 \\, ]$$$ is good and the number of ones in it is $$$4$$$.\nIt can be shown that there is no good array with less than $$$4$$$ ones, so the answer is $$$4$$$.\nIn the fourth test case, $$$n = 7$$$ and $$$k = 1$$$. The only good array is $$$[ \\, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\\, ]$$$, so the answer is $$$7$$$."

After that, each robot reports the number of robots standing in front of it\nin its line\n.\nAn example of robots' arrangement (the front of the lines is on the left). The robots report the numbers above.\nThe $$$i$$$-th robot reported number $$$l_i$$$. Unfortunately, John does not know which line each robot stands in, and can't check the reported numbers. Please determine if it is possible to form the lines in such a way that all reported numbers are correct, or not.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$), denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line in each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of robots.\nThe second line in each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$l_1, l_2, \\ldots, l_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq l_i < 100$$$), $$$l_i$$$ is equal to the number of robots in front of the $$$i$$$-th robot in its line.\nThe sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases won't exceed $$$200$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output \"\nYES\n\", if there exists a robot arrangement consistent with robots' reports. Otherwise, output \"\nNO\n\".\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"\nyEs\n\", \"\nyes\n\", \"\nYes\n\", and \"\nYES\n\" will be recognized as positive responses.\nExample\nInput\n5\n6\n0 1 2 0 1 0\n9\n0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2\n3\n0 0 2\n1\n99\n5\n0 1 2 3 4\nOutput\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nNote\nExample arrangement consistent with robot statements from the first example test case:\nExample arrangement consistent with robot statements from the second example is shown in the statement.\nIn the third test case, the third robot claims that there are two machines in front of it.

You can use any library you want. The test cases are provided in the code. Do not call the solve() function in your code. \nProgramming Problem: A. Unit Array\nGiven an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, which elements are equal to $$$-1$$$ and $$$1$$$. Let's call the array $$$a$$$\ngood\nif the following conditions are held at the same time:\n$$$a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n \\ge 0$$$;\n$$$a_1 \\cdot a_2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot a_n = 1$$$.\nIn one operation, you can select an arbitrary element of the array $$$a_i$$$ and change its value to the opposite. In other words, if $$$a_i = -1$$$, you can assign the value to $$$a_i := 1$$$, and if $$$a_i = 1$$$, then assign the value to $$$a_i := -1$$$.\nDetermine the minimum number of operations you need to perform to make the array $$$a$$$ good. It can be shown that this is always possible.\nInput\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) \u2014 the length of the array $$$a$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$a_i = \\pm 1$$$) \u2014 the elements of the array $$$a$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of operations that need to be done to make the $$$a$$$ array good.\nExample\nInput\n7\n4\n-1 -1 1 -1\n5\n-1 -1 -1 1 1\n4\n-1 1 -1 1\n3\n-1 -1 -1\n5\n1 1 1 1 1\n1\n-1\n2\n-1 -1\nOutput\n1\n1\n0\n3\n0\n1\n2\nNote\nIn the first test case, we can assign the value $$$a_1 := 1$$$. Then $$$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) = 0 \\ge 0$$$ and $$$a_1 \\cdot a_2 \\cdot a_3 \\cdot a_4 = 1 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1) = 1$$$.

The description of the test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$; $$$0 \\le k \\le \\frac{(n-1) n}{2}$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of required array and required $$$A$$$-characteristic.\nOutput\nFor each test case, if there is no array $$$a$$$ with given $$$A$$$-characteristic $$$k$$$, print\nNO\n.\nOtherwise, print\nYES\nand $$$n$$$ numbers $$$1$$$ and $$$-1$$$, which form the required array $$$a$$$. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\nExample\nInput\n7\n2 0\n2 1\n3 1\n3 2\n3 3\n5 4\n5 5\nOutput\nYES\n1 -1 \nYES\n1 1 \nYES\n1 -1 1 \nNO\nYES\n1 1 1 \nYES\n-1 1 -1 1 1 \nNO\nNote\nIn the first test case, there is only one pair of different elements in the array, and their product is $$$a_1 \\cdot a_2 = -1 \\neq 1$$$, hence its $$$A$$$-characteristic is $$$0$$$.\nIn the second test case, there is only one pair of different elements in the array, and their product is $$$a_1 \\cdot a_2 = 1$$$, hence its $$$A$$$-characteristic is $$$1$$$.\nIn the third test case, there are three pairs of different elements in the array, and their product are: $$$a_1 \\cdot a_2 = -1$$$, $$$a_1 \\cdot a_3 = 1$$$, $$$a_2 \\cdot a_3 = -1$$$, hence its $$$A$$$-characteristic is $$$1$$$.\nIn the fourth test case, we can show, that there is no array with length $$$3$$$, which $$$A$$$-characteristic is $$$2$$$."

Yura's New Name\nAfter holding one team contest, boy Yura got very tired and wanted to change his life and move to Japan. In honor of such a change, Yura changed his name to something nice.\nFascinated by this idea he already thought up a name $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters \"\n_\n\" and \"\n^\n\". But there's a problem \u2014 Yura likes smiley faces \"\n^_^\n\" and \"\n^^\n\". Therefore any character of the name must be a part of at least one such smiley. Note that only the\nconsecutive\ncharacters of the name can be a smiley face.\nMore formally, consider all occurrences of the strings \"\n^_^\n\" and \"\n^^\n\" in the string $$$s$$$. Then all such occurrences must cover the whole string $$$s$$$, possibly with intersections. For example, in the string \"\n^^__^_^^__^\n\" the characters at positions $$$3,4,9,10$$$ and $$$11$$$ are not contained inside any smileys, and the other characters at positions $$$1,2,5,6,7$$$ and $$$8$$$ are contained inside smileys.\nIn one operation Jura can insert one of the characters \"\n_\n\" and \"\n^\n\" into his name $$$s$$$ (you can insert it at any position in the string). He asks you to tell him the minimum number of operations you need to do to make the name fit Yura's criteria.\nInput\nEach test consists of multiple test cases.

In this case, they all agree during the first two discussions, after which the third member is in the minority during the third discussion. Then, the first and fifth members agree in the last discussion, and those two members stay till the end of the meeting.\nExample 5:\nThe club has $$$4$$$ members and $$$2$$$ opinions will be discussed.\nIf the first three members attend the meeting, the first member will be in the minority during the first discussion and will leave the club. After that, the second and third members will both disagree with the second opinion, and they both will stay till the end of the meeting. In this way, there will be 2 members left after the meeting, but it is an invalid outcome, as it forces the first member to leave. Therefore, the maximum number of 1 member is achieved if only the first member attends the meeting.",

Garland\nYou have a garland consisting of $$$4$$$ colored light bulbs, the color of the $$$i$$$-th light bulb is $$$s_i$$$.\nInitially, all the light bulbs are turned off. Your task is to turn all the light bulbs on. You can perform the following operation any number of times: select a light bulb and switch its state (turn it on if it was off, and turn it off if it was on). The only restriction on the above operation is that you can apply the operation to a light bulb only if the previous operation was applied to a light bulb of a different color (the first operation can be applied to any light bulb).\nCalculate the minimum number of operations to turn all the light bulbs on, or report that this is impossible.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\nThe single line of each test case contains $$$s$$$\u00a0\u2014 a sequence of $$$4$$$ characters, where each character is a decimal digit.

Is it possible to choose such a number $$$x$$$ that the value of the expression $$$b_1 \\oplus b_2 \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus b_n$$$ equals $$$0$$$?\nIt can be shown that if a valid number $$$x$$$ exists, then there also exists $$$x$$$ such that ($$$0 \\le x < 2^8$$$).\nInput\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^3$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the array $$$a$$$.\nThe second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers\u00a0\u2014 array $$$a$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i < 2^8$$$).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^3$$$.\nOutput\nFor each set test case, print the integer $$$x$$$ ($$$0 \\le x < 2^8$$$) if it exists, or $$$-1$$$ otherwise.\nExample\nInput\n5\n3\n1 2 5\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n0 1 2 3\n4\n1 2 2 3\n1\n1\nOutput\n6\n0\n3\n-1\n1\nNote\nIn the first test case, after applying the operation with the number $$$6$$$ the array $$$b$$$ becomes $$$[7, 4, 3]$$$, $$$7 \\oplus 4 \\oplus 3 = 0$$$.\nThere are other answers in the third test case, such as the number $$$0$$$."

It is guaranteed that there exists such a permutation of $$$b$$$ that it is a correct sequence of events described in the condition.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all input test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output two lines, each of which contains $$$n$$$ numbers.\nIn the first line, for each test case, output the maximum number of likes that Nikita could have at the announcement at the $$$i$$$th second.\nIn the second line, for each test case, output the minimum number of likes that Nikita could have at the announcement at the $$$i$$$th second.\nExample\nInput\n5\n3\n1 2 -2\n2\n1 -1\n6\n4 3 -1 2 1 -2\n5\n4 2 -2 1 3\n7\n-1 6 -4 3 2 4 1\nOutput\n1 2 1 \n1 0 1 \n1 0 \n1 0 \n1 2 3 4 3 2 \n1 0 1 0 1 2 \n1 2 3 4 3 \n1 0 1 2 3 \n1 2 3 4 5 4 3 \n1 0 1 0 1 2 3\nNote\nIn the first test case, the maximum values are reached with the following permutation: $$$1, 2, -2$$$. And the minimum values for such: $$$2, -2, 1$$$.\nIn the third test case, all maximal values are reached with the following permutation: $$$4, 2, 3, 1, -1, -2$$$. And the minimum values for the next permutation: $$$2, -2, 1, -1, 3, 4$$$."

Yet Another Promotion\nProgramming constraints: DO NOT use the following techniques\n- while loop\n- tuple\n- recursion\n- \n- for loop\nThe famous store \"Second Food\" sells groceries only two days a month. And the prices in each of days differ. You wanted to buy $$$n$$$ kilos of potatoes for a month. You know that on the first day of the month $$$1$$$ kilo of potatoes costs $$$a$$$ coins, and on the second day $$$b$$$ coins. In \"Second Food\" you can buy any\ninteger\nkilograms of potatoes.\nFortunately, \"Second Food\" has announced a promotion for potatoes, which is valid only on the first day of the month \u2014 for each $$$m$$$ kilos of potatoes you buy, you get $$$1$$$ kilo as a gift! In other words, you can get $$$m + 1$$$ kilograms by paying for $$$m$$$ kilograms.\nFind the minimum number of coins that you have to spend to buy\nat least\n$$$n$$$ kilos of potatoes.\nInput\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000$$$). Description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ $$$(1 \\leq a, b \\leq 10^9)$$$ \u2014 the prices of $$$1$$$ kilo of potatoes on the first and second days, respectively.\nThe second line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ $$$(1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^9)$$$ \u2014 the required amount of potatoes to buy and the amount of potatoes to use the promotion.\nOutput\nFor each test case print one integer \u2014 the minimum number of coins that you have to pay to buy at least $$$n$$$ kilos of potatoes.\nExample\nInput\n5\n5 4\n3 1\n5 4\n3 2\n3 4\n3 5\n20 15\n10 2\n1000000000 900000000\n1000000000 8\nOutput\n9\n10\n9\n135\n888888888900000000\nNote\nIn the first test case, on the first day you buy $$$1$$$ kilo and get $$$1$$$ more for a promotion.

For example,\n010010\nis a palindrome but\n10111\nis not.\nInput\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t\\leq 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\leq n\\leq 10^5$$$) \u2014 the length of string $$$s$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Only characters\n0\nand\n1\ncan appear in $$$s$$$.\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print\nYes\nif $$$s$$$ can be a palindrome after performing Inversion Magic exactly once, and print\nNo\nif not.\nYou can output\nYes\nand\nNo\nin any case (for example, strings\nyEs\n,\nyes\n,\nYes\nand\nYES\nwill be recognized as a positive response).\nExample\nInput\n3\n4\n1001\n5\n10010\n7\n0111011\nOutput\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNote\nIn the first test case, Serval can perform Inversion Magic on the segment $$$[1,4]$$$. The string $$$s$$$ will be\n0110\nafter the magic.\nIn the second test case, Serval can perform Inversion Magic on the segment $$$[1,3]$$$. The string $$$s$$$ will be\n01110\nafter the magic.\nIn the third test case, Serval can't make $$$s$$$ a palindrome by performing Inversion Magic exactly once."

The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\leq n\\leq 100$$$) \u2014 the length of array $$$a$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n\\leq 10^6$$$) \u2014 the elements of array $$$a$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print\nYes\nif it is possible to reorder the elements in $$$a$$$ to make it beautiful, and print\nNo\nif not.\nYou can output\nYes\nand\nNo\nin any case (for example, strings\nyEs\n,\nyes\n,\nYes\nand\nYES\nwill be recognized as a positive response).\nExample\nInput\n6\n2\n3 6\n3\n1 2 4\n3\n3 6 1\n3\n15 35 21\n4\n35 10 35 14\n5\n1261 227821 143 4171 1941\nOutput\nNo\nYes\nYes\nNo\nYes\nYes\nNote\nIn the first test case, neither $$$[3,6]$$$ nor $$$[6,3]$$$ are beautiful, so it's impossible to obtain a beautiful array by reordering the elements in $$$a$$$.\nIn the second test case, $$$[1,2,4]$$$ is already beautiful. Keeping the array $$$a$$$ unchanged can obtain a beautiful array."

Everybody Likes Good Arrays!\nProgramming constraints: DO NOT use the following techniques\n- break statement\n- tuple\n- for loop\n- matrix operation\n- if statement\nAn array $$$a$$$ is\ngood\nif for all pairs of adjacent elements, $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i+1}$$$ ($$$1\\le i \\lt n$$$) are of\ndifferent\nparity. Note that an array of size $$$1$$$ is trivially good.\nYou are given an array of size $$$n$$$.\nIn one operation you can select any pair of adjacent elements in which both elements are of the\nsame\nparity, delete them, and insert their product in the same position.\nFind the minimum number of operations to form a good array.\nInput\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$).\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^{9}$$$).\nOutput\nFor each test case print an integer, the minimum number of operations required to form a good array.\nExample\nInput\n3\n5\n1 7 11 2 13\n4\n1 2 3 4\n6\n1 1 1 2 2 3\nOutput\n2\n0\n3\nNote\nConsider the first test case. Select the $$$2$$$-nd and the $$$3$$$-rd integers and apply the operation on them. The array changes from $$$[1, \\color{red}{7}, \\color{red}{11}, 2, 13]$$$ to $$$[1, \\color{red}{77}, 2, 13]$$$. Next, select the $$$1$$$-st and the $$$2$$$-nd integers, array changes from $$$[\\color{red}{1}, \\color{red}{77}, 2, 13]$$$ to $$$[\\color{red}{77}, 2, 13]$$$. Thus we require $$$2$$$ operations.

The matrix is beautiful if the following two conditions are satisfied:\nin each row, the first element is smaller than the second element;\nin each column, the first element is smaller than the second element.\nYou can perform the following operation on the matrix any number of times: rotate it clockwise by $$$90$$$ degrees, so the top left element shifts to the top right cell, the top right element shifts to the bottom right cell, and so on:\nDetermine if it is possible to make the matrix beautiful by applying zero or more operations.\nInput\nThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of two lines. Each of those lines contains two integers \u2014 the elements of the corresponding row of the matrix. In each matrix, all four elements are distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$100$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print\nYES\nif the matrix can become beautiful, or\nNO\notherwise. You may print each letter in any case (\nYES\n,\nyes\n,\nYes\nwill all be recognized as positive answer,\nNO\n,\nno\nand\nnO\nwill all be recognized as negative answer).\nExample\nInput\n6\n1 3\n5 7\n8 10\n3 4\n8 10\n4 3\n6 1\n9 2\n7 5\n4 2\n1 2\n4 3\nOutput\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\nNO"

Broken Keyboard\nRecently, Mishka started noticing that his keyboard malfunctions \u2014 maybe it's because he was playing rhythm games too much. Empirically, Mishka has found out that every other time he presses a key, it is registered as if the key was pressed twice. For example, if Mishka types text, the first time he presses a key, exactly one letter is printed; the second time he presses a key, two same letters are printed; the third time he presses a key, one letter is printed; the fourth time he presses a key, two same letters are printed, and so on. Note that the number of times a key was pressed is counted for the whole keyboard, not for each key separately. For example, if Mishka tries to type the word\nosu\n, it will be printed on the screen as\nossu\n.\nYou are given a word consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters. You have to determine if it can be printed on Mishka's keyboard or not. You may assume that Mishka cannot delete letters from the word, and every time he presses a key, the new letter (or letters) is appended to the end of the word.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nThe first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) \u2014 the length of the word.\nThe second line of the test case contains a string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters \u2014 the word that should be checked.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print\nYES\nif the word $$$s$$$ can be printed on Mishka's keyboard, and\nNO\notherwise.\nExample\nInput\n4\n4\nossu\n2\naa\n6\naddonn\n3\nqwe\nOutput\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNote\nIn the first test case, Mishka can type the word as follows: press\no\n(one letter\no\nappears at the end of the word), then presses\ns\n(two letters\ns\nappear at the end of the word), and, finally, press\nu\n(one letter appears at the end of the word, making the resulting word\nossu\n).\nIn the second test case, Mishka can try typing the word as follows: press\na\n(one letter\na\nappears at the end of the word). But if he tries to press\na\none more time, two letters\na\nwill appear at the end of the word, so it is impossible to print the word using his keyboard.\nIn the fourth test case, Mishka has to start by pressing\nq\n. Then, if he presses\nw\n, two copies of\nw\nwill appear at the end of the word, but the third letter should be\ne\ninstead of\nw\n, so the answer is\nNO\n.",

You can use any library you want. The test cases are provided in the code. Do not call the solve() function in your code. \nProgramming Problem: A. Absolute Maximization\nYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You can perform the following operation several (possibly, zero) times:\nChoose $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$b$$$: Swap the $$$b$$$-th digit in the binary representation of $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$.\nFind the maximum possible value of $$$\\max(a) - \\min(a)$$$.\nIn a binary representation, bits are numbered from right (least significant) to left (most significant). Consider that there are an infinite number of leading zero bits at the beginning of any binary representation.\nFor example, swap the $$$0$$$-th bit for $$$4=100_2$$$ and $$$3=11_2$$$ will result $$$101_2=5$$$ and $$$10_2=2$$$.

Kevin and Permutation\nFor his birthday, Kevin received the set of pairwise distinct numbers $$$1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n$$$ as a gift.\nHe is going to arrange these numbers in a way such that the minimum absolute difference between two consecutive numbers be maximum possible. More formally, if he arranges numbers in order $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$, he wants to maximize the value $$$$$$\\min \\limits_{i=1}^{n - 1} \\lvert p_{i + 1} - p_i \\rvert,$$$$$$ where $$$|x|$$$ denotes the absolute value of $$$x$$$.\nHelp Kevin to do that.\nInput\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\leq 1\\,000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the size of the set.\nOutput\nFor each test case print a single line containing $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$) describing the arrangement that maximizes the minimum absolute difference of consecutive elements.\nFormally, you have to print a permutation $$$p$$$ which maximizes the value $$$\\min \\limits_{i=1}^{n - 1} \\lvert p_{i + 1} - p_i \\rvert$$$.\nIf there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.\nExample\nInput\n2\n4\n3\nOutput\n2 4 1 3\n1 2 3\nNote\nIn the first test case the minimum absolute difference of consecutive elements equals $$$\\min \\{\\lvert 4 - 2 \\rvert, \\lvert 1 - 4 \\rvert, \\lvert 3 - 1 \\rvert \\} = \\min \\{2, 3, 2\\} = 2$$$. It's easy to prove that this answer is optimal.\nIn the second test case each permutation of numbers $$$1, 2, 3$$$ is an optimal answer.

Monocarp also remembers some digits which were definitely not used in the password.\nYou have to calculate the number of different sequences of $$$4$$$ digits that could be the password for Monocarp's mobile phone (i.\u2009e. these sequences should meet all constraints on Monocarp's password).\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 200$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of testcases.\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 8$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of digits for which Monocarp remembers that they were not used in the password.\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ different integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 9$$$) representing the digits that were not used in the password. Note that the digits $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ are given in ascending order.\nOutput\nFor each testcase, print one integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of different $$$4$$$-digit sequences that meet the constraints.\nExample\nInput\n2\n8\n0 1 2 4 5 6 8 9\n1\n8\nOutput\n6\n216\nNote\nIn the first example, all possible passwords are: \"\n3377\n\", \"\n3737\n\", \"\n3773\n\", \"\n7337\n\", \"\n7373\n\", \"\n7733\n\"."

If they are equal, it means the list is strictly increasing, and we print 'YES'. If not, we print 'NO'.",
            "```bash\npython\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n        if a == a[1:] + a[:1]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nsolve()\n```"

Jumbo Extra Cheese 2\nPak Chanek has $$$n$$$ two-dimensional slices of cheese. The $$$i$$$-th slice of cheese can be represented as a rectangle of dimensions $$$a_i \\times b_i$$$. We want to arrange them on the two-dimensional plane such that:\nEach edge of each cheese is parallel to either the x-axis or the y-axis.\nThe bottom edge of each cheese is a segment of the x-axis.\nNo two slices of cheese overlap, but their sides can touch.\nThey form one connected shape.\nNote that we can arrange them in any order (the leftmost slice of cheese is not necessarily the first slice of cheese). Also note that we can rotate each slice of cheese in any way as long as all conditions still hold.\nFind the minimum possible perimeter of the constructed shape.\nInput\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases.

Immobile Knight\nProgramming constraints: DO NOT use the following techniques\n- while loop\n- hashmap\n- tuple\n- for loop\n- if statement\nThere is a chess board of size $$$n \\times m$$$. The rows are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$.\nLet's call a cell\nisolated\nif a knight placed in that cell can't move to any other cell on the board. Recall that a chess knight moves two cells in one direction and one cell in a perpendicular direction:\nFind any\nisolated\ncell on the board. If there are no such cells, print any cell on the board.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 64$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of testcases.\nThe only line of each testcase contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 8$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of rows and columns of the board.\nOutput\nFor each testcase, print two integers\u00a0\u2014 the row and the column of any\nisolated\ncell on the board. If there are no such cells, print any cell on the board.\nExample\nInput\n3\n1 7\n8 8\n3 3\nOutput\n1 7\n7 2\n2 2\nNote\nIn the first testcase, all cells are\nisolated\n. A knight can't move from any cell of the board to any other one. Thus, any cell on board is a correct answer.\nIn the second testcase, there are no\nisolated\ncells. On a normal chess board, a knight has at least two moves from any cell. Thus, again, any cell is a correct answer.\nIn the third testcase, only the middle cell of the board is\nisolated\n. The knight can move freely around the border of the board, but can't escape the middle."

The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 300$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of sticks.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the lengths of the sticks.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$300$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print one integer on a single line\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of operations to be made.\nExample\nInput\n4\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n7 3 7 3\n5\n3 4 2 1 1\n8\n3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6\nOutput\n2\n4\n1\n1\nNote\nIn the first test case, you can increase the length of the first stick by $$$1$$$, then decrease the length of the third stick by $$$1$$$. In total, you perform $$$2$$$ operations, such that the three sticks form an equilateral triangle of side length $$$2$$$.\nIn the fourth test case, you can decrease the length of the seventh stick by $$$1$$$. An equilateral triangle of side length $$$1$$$ can be selected and formed by the second, fourth, and seventh sticks."

Decode String\nPolycarp has a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters.\nHe encodes it using the following algorithm.\nHe goes through the letters of the string $$$s$$$ from left to right and for each letter Polycarp considers its number in the alphabet:\nif the letter number is single-digit number (less than $$$10$$$), then just writes it out;\nif the letter number is a two-digit number (greater than or equal to $$$10$$$), then it writes it out and adds the number\n0\nafter.\nFor example, if the string $$$s$$$ is\ncode\n, then Polycarp will encode this string as follows:\n'\nc\n'\u00a0\u2014 is the $$$3$$$-rd letter of the alphabet. Consequently, Polycarp adds\n3\nto the code (the code becomes equal to\n3\n);\n'\no\n'\u00a0\u2014 is the $$$15$$$-th letter of the alphabet.

Your task is to decode it (get the original string $$$s$$$ by $$$t$$$).\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 10^4$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input.\nThe descriptions of the test cases follow.\nThe first line of description of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 50$$$) \u2014 the length of the given code.\nThe second line of the description of each test case contains a string $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$ \u2014 the given code. It is guaranteed that there exists such a string of lowercase Latin letters, as a result of encoding which the string $$$t$$$ is obtained.\nOutput\nFor each test case output the required string $$$s$$$ \u2014 the string that gives string $$$t$$$ as the result of encoding. It is guaranteed that such a string always exists. It can be shown that such a string is always unique.\nExample\nInput\n9\n6\n315045\n4\n1100\n7\n1213121\n6\n120120\n18\n315045615018035190\n7\n1111110\n7\n1111100\n5\n11111\n4\n2606\nOutput\ncode\naj\nabacaba\nll\ncodeforces\naaaak\naaaaj\naaaaa\nzf\nNote\nThe first test case is explained above.\nIn the second test case, the answer is\naj\n. Indeed, the number of the letter\na\nis equal to $$$1$$$, so\n1\nwill be appended to the code. The number of the letter\nj\nis $$$10$$$, so\n100\nwill be appended to the code. The resulting code is\n1100\n.\nThere are no zeros in the third test case, which means that the numbers of all letters are less than $$$10$$$ and are encoded as one digit. The original string is\nabacaba\n.\nIn the fourth test case, the string $$$s$$$ is equal to\nll\n. The letter\nl\nhas the number $$$12$$$ and is encoded as\n120\n. So\nll\nis indeed\n120120\n."

As an answer, output:\n$$$1$$$, if it is better to call the first elevator;\n$$$2$$$, if it is better to call the second one;\n$$$3$$$, if it doesn't matter which elevator to call (both elevators will arrive in the same time).\nExample\nInput\n3\n1 2 3\n3 1 2\n3 2 1\nOutput\n1\n3\n2\nNote\nIn the first test case of the example, the first elevator is already on the floor of $$$1$$$.\nIn the second test case of the example, when called, the elevators would move as follows:\nAt the time of the call, the first elevator is on the floor of $$$3$$$, and the second one is on the floor of $$$1$$$, but is already going to another floor;\nin $$$1$$$ second after the call, the first elevator would be on the floor $$$2$$$, the second one would also reach the floor $$$2$$$ and now can go to the floor $$$1$$$;\nin $$$2$$$ seconds, any elevator would reach the floor $$$1$$$.\nIn the third test case of the example, the first elevator will arrive in $$$2$$$ seconds, and the second in $$$1$$$."

Next, he takes all the integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and splits them all into pairs $$$(a, b)$$$ (each integer must be in exactly one pair) so that for each pair the integer $$$(a + k) \\cdot b$$$ is divisible by $$$4$$$ (\nnote that the order of the numbers in the pair matters\n), or reports that, unfortunately for viewers, such a split is impossible.\nBurenka really likes such performances, so she asked her friend Tonya to be a magician, and also gave him the numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$.\nTonya is a wolf, and as you know, wolves do not perform in the circus, even in a mathematical one.

Burenka really wants to win the game, but she is too lazy to come up with a strategy, so you are invited to solve the difficult task of finding it. Name the winner of the game (it is believed that Burenka and Tonya are masters of playing with chips, so they always move in the optimal way).\nChip's starting cell is green, the only cell from which chip can't move is red. if the chip is in the yellow cell, then blue cells are all options to move the chip in one move.\nInput\nThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases. The following is a description of the input data sets.\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^9$$$) \u2014 the dimensions of the game board.\nOutput\nFor each test case print a single line \u2014 the name of the winner of the game (\"\nBurenka\n\" or \"\nTonya\n\").\nExample\nInput\n6\n1 1\n1 4\n5 6\n2 2\n6 3\n999999999 1000000000\nOutput\nTonya\nBurenka\nBurenka\nTonya\nBurenka\nBurenka\nNote\nIn the first case, Burenka has no move, so Tonya wins.\nIn the second case, Burenka can move $$$3$$$ cells to the right, after which Tony will not be able to make a move, which means that Burenka wins.\nIn the third case, Burenka can move $$$5$$$ squares to the right. Then we can say that we have a game on a board of $$$1 \\times 5$$$ cells, and Tonya is the first player. In such game the second player wins, so in the original one Burenka will win."

Another String Minimization Problem\nProgramming constraints: DO NOT use the following techniques\n- \n- matrix operation\n- if statement\n- while loop\n- for loop\nYou have a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$m$$$. You also have a string $$$s$$$, consisting of $$$m$$$ characters\nB\n.\nYou are going to perform the following $$$n$$$ operations.\nAt the $$$i$$$-th ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) operation, you replace either the $$$a_i$$$-th\nor\nthe $$$(m + 1 - a_i)$$$-th character of $$$s$$$ with\nA\n. You can replace the character at any position multiple times through the operations.\nFind the lexicographically smallest string you can get after these operations.\nA string $$$x$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$y$$$ of the same length if and only if in the first position where $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ differ, the string $$$x$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$y$$$.\nInput\nThe first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2000$$$).\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 50$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the sequence $$$a$$$ and the length of the string $$$s$$$ respectively.\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le m$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the sequence $$$a$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a string of length $$$m$$$\u00a0\u2014 the lexicographically smallest string you can get. Each character of the string should be either capital English letter\nA\nor capital English letter\nB\n.\nExample\nInput\n6\n4 5\n1 1 3 1\n1 5\n2\n4 1\n1 1 1 1\n2 4\n1 3\n2 7\n7 5\n4 5\n5 5 3 5\nOutput\nABABA\nBABBB\nA\nAABB\nABABBBB\nABABA\nNote\nIn the first test case, the sequence $$$a = [1, 1, 3, 1]$$$. One of the possible solutions is the following.\nAt the $$$1$$$-st operation, you can replace the $$$1$$$-st character of $$$s$$$ with\nA\n. After it, $$$s$$$ becomes\nA\nBBBB\n.\nAt the $$$2$$$-nd operation, you can replace the $$$5$$$-th character of $$$s$$$ with\nA\n(since $$$m+1-a_2=5$$$). After it, $$$s$$$ becomes\nABBB\nA\n.\nAt the $$$3$$$-rd operation, you can replace the $$$3$$$-rd character of $$$s$$$ with\nA\n. After it, $$$s$$$ becomes\nAB\nA\nBA\n.\nAt the $$$4$$$-th operation, you can replace the $$$1$$$-st character of $$$s$$$ with\nA\n.

However, to ensure that everyone is seen properly, the $$$j$$$-th person of the back row must be at least $$$x$$$ units taller than the $$$j$$$-th person of the front row for each $$$j$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, inclusive.\nHelp Mark determine if this is possible.\nInput\nThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t\\leq 100$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines.\nThe first line of each test case contains two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1\\leq n\\leq 100$$$, $$$1\\leq x\\leq 10^3$$$) \u2014 the number of people in each row and the minimum difference Mark wants.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$2n$$$ positive integers $$$h_1,h_2,\\ldots,h_{2n}$$$ ($$$1\\leq h_i\\leq 10^3$$$) \u2014 the height of each person in units.\nNote that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases is not bounded.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing \"\nYES\n\" if Mark could arrange people satisfying his condition and \"\nNO\n\" otherwise.\nYou may print each letter in any case (for example,\nYES\n,\nYes\n,\nyes\n,\nyEs\nwill all be recognized as positive answers).\nExample\nInput\n3\n3 6\n1 3 9 10 12 16\n3 1\n2 5 2 2 2 5\n1 2\n8 6\nOutput\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNote\nIn the first test case, one possible order is to have the third, fifth, and sixth person on the back row and the second, first, and fourth on the front row. The heights of the people will look like this.\nBack\n$$$9$$$\n$$$12$$$\n$$$16$$$\nFront\n$$$3$$$\n$$$1$$$\n$$$10$$$\nIt works because\n$$$h_3-h_2 = 9-3 \\geq 6$$$,\n$$$h_5-h_1 = 12-1\\geq 6$$$, and\n$$$h_6-h_4 = 16-10\\geq 6$$$.\nIn the second test case, it can be shown there is no way to order people in a way that satisfies the condition.\nIn the third test case, the only way to arrange people to satisfy the condition is to have the first person on the back row and the second person on the front row."

Two 0-1 Sequences\nProgramming constraints: DO NOT use the following techniques\n- queue\n- recursion\n- while loop\n- for loop\n- break statement\nAquaMoon has two binary sequences $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, which contain only $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$. AquaMoon can perform the following two operations any number of times ($$$a_1$$$ is the first element of $$$a$$$, $$$a_2$$$ is the second element of $$$a$$$, and so on):\nOperation 1\n: if $$$a$$$ contains at least two elements, change $$$a_2$$$ to $$$\\operatorname{min}(a_1,a_2)$$$, and remove the first element of $$$a$$$.\nOperation 2\n: if $$$a$$$ contains at least two elements, change $$$a_2$$$ to $$$\\operatorname{max}(a_1,a_2)$$$, and remove the first element of $$$a$$$.\nNote that after a removal of the first element of $$$a$$$, the former $$$a_2$$$ becomes the first element of $$$a$$$, the former $$$a_3$$$ becomes the second element of $$$a$$$ and so on, and the length of $$$a$$$ reduces by one.\nDetermine if AquaMoon can make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$ by using these operations.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 2\\,000$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,m \\leq 50$$$, $$$m \\leq n$$$) \u2014 the lengths of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ respectively.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$.\nThe third line of each test case contains a string $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$, consisting only $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output \"YES\" if AquaMoon can change $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$ by using these options; otherwise, output \"NO\".\nYou may print each letter in any case (for example, \"YES\", \"Yes\", \"yes\", \"yEs\" will all be recognized as a positive answer).\nExample\nInput\n10\n6 2\n001001\n11\n6 2\n110111\n01\n6 2\n000001\n11\n6 2\n111111\n01\n8 5\n10000101\n11010\n7 4\n1010001\n1001\n8 6\n01010010\n010010\n8 4\n01010101\n1001\n8 4\n10101010\n0110\n7 5\n1011100\n11100\nOutput\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nNote\nIn the first test case, you can use\nOperation 2\nfour times to make $$$a$$$ equals to $$$b$$$.\nIn the second test case, you can use\nOperation 1\nfour times to make $$$a$$$ equals to $$$b$$$.\nIn the third test case, it can be proved that no matter how we use the operations, it is impossible to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$.\nIn the fourth test case, it can be proved that no matter how we use the operations, it is impossible to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$.\nIn the fifth test case, you can use\nOperation 2\nthree times to make $$$a$$$ become $$$10101$$$, so the first element of $$$a$$$ equals to the first element of $$$b$$$, but it can be proved that no matter how to operate, the second to the fifth elements of $$$a$$$ can't be the same as $$$b$$$."

In the cell $$$(i, j)$$$ there is written a number $$$(i - 1) \\cdot m + j$$$, that is $$$a_{ij} = (i - 1) \\cdot m + j$$$.\nA turtle initially stands in the cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ and it wants to come to the cell $$$(n, m)$$$. From the cell $$$(i, j)$$$ it can in one step go to one of the cells $$$(i + 1, j)$$$ or $$$(i, j + 1)$$$, if it exists. A path is a sequence of cells in which for every two adjacent in the sequence cells the following satisfies: the turtle can reach from the first cell to the second cell in one step. A cost of a path is the sum of numbers that are written in the cells of the path.\nFor example, with $$$n = 2$$$ and $$$m = 3$$$ the table will look as shown above. The turtle can take the following path: $$$(1, 1) \\rightarrow (1, 2) \\rightarrow (1, 3) \\rightarrow (2, 3)$$$. The cost of such way is equal to $$$a_{11} + a_{12} + a_{13} + a_{23} = 12$$$. On the other hand, the paths $$$(1, 1) \\rightarrow (1, 2) \\rightarrow (2, 2) \\rightarrow (2, 1)$$$ and $$$(1, 1) \\rightarrow (1, 3)$$$ are incorrect, because in the first path the turtle can't make a step $$$(2, 2) \\rightarrow (2, 1)$$$, and in the second path it can't make a step $$$(1, 1) \\rightarrow (1, 3)$$$.\nYou are asked to tell the turtle a minimal possible cost of a path from the cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ to the cell $$$(n, m)$$$. Please note that the cells $$$(1, 1)$$$ and $$$(n, m)$$$ are a part of the way.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\nA single line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^4$$$) \u2014 the number of rows and columns of the table $$$a$$$ respectively.\nOutput\nFor each test case output a single integer \u2014 a minimal possible cost of a path from the cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ to the cell $$$(n, m)$$$.\nExample\nInput\n7\n1 1\n2 3\n3 2\n7 1\n1 10\n5 5\n10000 10000\nOutput\n1\n12\n13\n28\n55\n85\n500099995000\nNote\nIn the first test case the only possible path consists of a single cell $$$(1, 1)$$$.\nThe path with the minimal cost in the second test case is shown in the statement.\nIn the fourth and the fifth test cases there is only one path from $$$(1, 1)$$$ to $$$(n, m)$$$. Both paths visit every cell in the table.",
